The old practice that starts when fear of missing deadlines kicks in, and gets perfected when you get away with it. Somebody will pay, sooner or later... hopefully not you.

Beyond the ethical implications, this behavior isn't sustainable long term. It's a snowball effect, harder to stop the larger it grows. Everybody ends up resentful. Again, toxic culture.

To focus more on the output than on the process, at all costs, is the recipe for disaster. The moment a change is required, this house of cards collapses.

In tech jargon this is called technical debt, and what's interesting is that it already includes in its definition the cost of redoing stuff the right way.

In tech, technical debt is easier to spot because software is tested manually, but also automatically... and here's where the magic is. Apps are functional tested, unit tested, integration tested, security tested, tested end-to-end, early on from development and even during distribution.

In AEC, technical debt manifests differently. Not by your app crashing tomorrow and some overtime debugging it, but with rework that doubles your timeline, with coordination issues that cascade through every trade, and eventually with you or your colleague having a burnout in a couple of months.

The implications go deeper than we admit. Cut corners on documentation? The next team starts from scratch. Skip proper coordination? Field conflicts multiply. Rush the modeling? Fabrication errors follow.

How do we stay away from technical debt?

Appoint people with industry knowledge. Experience pays for itself.
Define scopes properly. Ambiguity is expensive.
Manage expectations. Better to underpromise and overdeliver.
Make proofing a must. Review saves more time than it costs.
Embrace a 
Work mindfully. Stay in the middle path.

This is how a proper data pipeline looks like.

The irony? What feels like saving time always costs more time later. The art isn't in cutting corners... it's in knowing where not to cut them.

What does technical debt look like in your projects? How do you spot it before it compounds?

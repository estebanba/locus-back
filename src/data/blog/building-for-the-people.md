"Building the machine that builds the machine".

I fell in love with this concept while working at the Tesla Gigafactory.

This is the apex of thinking in systems. This is thinking beyond the product: yes, redesign the car, not only for its users, but also to make it easier to produce and reduce its impact, thus benefiting all. Continual improving of manufacturing processes requires more human input, not the other way around.

I want to take this thought slightly in another direction.

If you think about what the role of a software engineer in the AEC industry is... An industry that doesn't have such level of technification and automation, instead relying more on human labor, intellectually but mostly physically, if we were meant to enhance their capabilities, not replace them, then it could be:

"Building for the people building for the people".

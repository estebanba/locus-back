For too long AEC has been looking at the automotive industry for inspiration. "What if houses were manufactured like cars?", "Let's build houses offsite". Modular construction, industrialization, prefabrication, you name it.

In this interview, Jim Farley, CEO of Ford, explains some of the struggles they have when dealing just with hardware and software, the IT of the car, being outsourced to hundreds of providers that compete between each other for the lowest price. Then Ford has to put these parts altogether, with all their complexity, and expect to work smoothly. And they hope nothing needs a change, as they are hands-tied regarding third-parties IP and access to the source code. Everything takes longer, mistake rates increase and everybody ends up with little margins if not loses.

Does it sound familiar?

Then came Tesla and changed the game. Farley mentions Tesla strength: vertical integration. They took ownership and control of activities that were previously performed by suppliers or distributors, bringing those processes in-house. They do all the critical tech in-house, and this way they managed to control their own supply chain, increased control over quality and costs, which lead to a raise in profits and reduced reliance on external vendors, which led to space for greater innovation.

Just like Ford, AEC companies lack vertical integration. Attempts failed. Bad timing? Established interests protecting their turf? Probably both.

Still, AEC tries harder and has been having its Ford moment for too long now, a model that shows its cracks. Let it not step on the same stones. We can learn from the giants mistakes.

Or, on the other hand, a new player enters the game, with a revolutionary approach to construction, overcoming all the artificial barriers set up by years of vicious practices and renders all the rest obsolete. I think this might be happening soon.

AEC still needs to find its path. Maybe it is not vertical integration that is missing, but a way of properly transfer information and connect the dots. Maybe the Tesla of construction won't own concrete plants and steel factories, they will own the information architecture that makes everything else work seamlessly.

I wonder, what would this new player actually look like? What would they do differently on day one?

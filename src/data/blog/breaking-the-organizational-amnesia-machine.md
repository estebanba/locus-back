There was this big project almost done, and a new one about to begin, an even bigger one. But we felt invincible this time. Tons of learnings, templates created, trained colleagues. This one would be easier. We have walked the way.

Then reality kicked in. Kick-off meeting. On the other side, all new faces. And they were the same GC and the same client.

Deja Vu. The same miscommunication, discussing about standards, scopes, coordination issues, all over again. As Marx said, "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce".

That collective intelligence that solved many issues the first time was gone. Now we were left with first graders ready to learn from us.

People turnover: the team that learned together isn't the team that builds together. 

Knowledge silos: insights trapped in individual heads or, best case scenario, small teams instead of shared systems.

Tool fragmentation: learning scattered across platforms that don't talk to each other.

Every forgotten lesson is a lesson that will be re-learned, and it will be expensive.

Forgetting compounds.

So how do we break this vicious cycle?

Make learning visible: track it, not only what was delivered, but include the process, even that messy one.

Create learning artifacts: transform project insights into reusable knowledge. Templates are the magic word here, not just model or document templates, but decision templates that capture the "why" behind the "what."

Build learning loops: run retrospectives and feed them systematically into the next project planning. Connect the end of one project with the beginning of the next.

Reward teaching: recognize and incentivize knowledge share, allocate time for this. Make internal training and mentoring part of the career development.

The competitive advantage isn't just better execution. It's faster learning.

What did your last project teach you that your next project won't benefit from?

What construction should actually copy from manufacturing 01. 

Factories are cool. I worked at the Tesla Gigafactory, the coolest factory ever built. But what does AEC keep missing?, we don't need factories to start. We need systematic learning.

Systematic Learning is the the process of capturing, refining, and reapplying knowledge across projects.

We keep trying to copy manufacturing's end result (speed, scale, efficiency) instead of their process. AEC looks at Tesla's factory output and thinks "we need robot arms and conveyor belts".

But manufacturing's real advantage isn't the machinery, it's how they capture and transfer knowledge. Every defect becomes data, every improvement gets systematized, every worker's insight feeds back into the process.

In manufacturing, when something goes wrong, they don't just fix it, they figure out why it went wrong and how to prevent it system-wide. Each product iteration builds on learnings from the previous one. Compare this to construction: we finish a project, the team disperses, lessons learned die with the project.

Those wooden joints in the image represent centuries of systematic learning. Each joint type was developed, refined, and passed down through generations. The knowledge didn't disappear when the master retired, it was codified, taught, improved upon by the students. That's systematic learning in its purest form.

It's not about the tools, it's about the systematic refinement of knowledge over time.

What would happen if we approached construction like those Japanese craftsmen approached wooden joinery?

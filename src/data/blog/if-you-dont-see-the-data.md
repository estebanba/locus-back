Every design decision informs the project. Informed means it now has knowledge, understanding. It's not random anymore.

You put hours into a design. Every decision gets coded in sketches, drawings, models, spreadsheets, materials, and finally the building. After each step you deliver and move on.

A lot of data in, a lot of data out. So abundant... yet invisible. Not being seen, not being harnessed. A missed opportunity. Best case scenario? It stays in your head. But your organization forgets.

And data isn't something you add later to make your project a "BIM project." It's already there and it can enhance your processes. You don't need to wait until Mr. BIM is in the room to start thinking about data.

How many sketches have you already produced? Are there different versions? Start by versioning them: v0, v1, v1.1, v2. Pick your favorite convention, you can change it later.

But it doesn't end there. You need to go deeper.

Branch it. Explore it. Clean it. Label it. Analyze it. Sort it. Make charts. Visualize it. Produce insights. And now, finally... make informed decisions. Better decisions.

Your organization learns. You get wisdom.

This isn't about BIM software or futuristic tools. It's about seeing the information that's already flowing through your process and treating it like the valuable resource it is.

What data are you already seeing around that could make your next decision better?

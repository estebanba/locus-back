When I worked in logistic projects, I was again and again amazed by how Amazon works. Your coffee mug purchase gets tracked in real-time while a building permit stays in the darkness for months. They have polished their information processes almost to perfection, and this is reflected in your orders arriving the same day, while the competition struggles to keep punctuality.  
  
This is where the AEC industry is broken, and there is so far no AEC-Amazon to show the way.  
  
We have to build these systems from the ground up. Treating information like manufactured products with inputs, processes, quality control, and distribution.  
  
Supply chain thinking is mature and measurable, applying it to information could improve knowledge handling by orders of magnitude. We could be exploring data sources and ownership history, information logistics, knowledge inventory management.  
  
Industries like Amazon and Tesla didn't just optimize products, they industrialized their information processes.  
  
The graveyard of construction tech is full of solutions that missed this fundamental insight. Again, it's not just about better software... it's about reimagining information as a supply chain.  
  
Do you think we can apply their methods to AEC? What would construction look like with Amazon level information flow?

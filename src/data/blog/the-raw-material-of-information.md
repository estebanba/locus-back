Just as you wouldn't build your structure with poor quality concrete, you shouldn't make decisions with low-grade data.

AEC has relied for too long on little information and gut feelings, gross estimates for the decision making. In face of uncertainty and doubt, professionals are required to have courage, the stakes are big.

You can do this maybe for a little house in the countryside, but for an airport project? Errors will follow, hands on the head, blaming, scapegoating, rework, reschedule, re-budgeting. So much stress, no doubt your work environment turns toxic after a while.

To avoid this, precision is required. How do you achieve precision? By taking care of the data pipeline. In software engineering, if the code has errors, it just won't make it through the data pipeline. It will get stopped somewhere, warnings will get triggered and review and debugging will be required.

For AEC this shouldn't be so different.

Maybe this suggests an entire industrial framework: data mining, information refining, knowledge manufacturing. This could become a whole maturity model for information quality in AEC, exploring stages of data refinement and the equivalent of materials testing for information. And when the project is over, let the loop start over. Re-use the knowledge and feed the data back into the process. Not only you learned something, but your organization did as well.

This industrial framework has an unexpected by-product. Wisdom is the most valuable gem in our process. But wisdom is not achieved through the same means than the previous sub-products. Wisdom is what is left, if you know where to look.

Wisdom is the human factor. This is gut feeling, but now you know where it comes from and what it is about. With wisdom you will know what knowledge should be applied where and when and be less prone to errors.

Be wise first, courageous later.

What do you think about this? Could AEC benefit from treating information like we treat materials?

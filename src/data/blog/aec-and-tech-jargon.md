First it was BIM, but everything is AI these days.

Not so far ago, I had to explain what BIM means to every person in tech I met. Architecture doesn't relate to the built environment as much as developers don't develop land but code. Two different worlds speaking different languages.

This has changed recently.

Prop-tech has been around for a while. But Con-tech is catching up fast. New SaaS everywhere. Startups riding the AI hype. Most of them just wrappers, honestly. Many are VC backed in the already traditional fashion. But some are different... bootstrapped, run by indie hackers and solopreneurs. Building in public or stealth mode. Making it slowly into the scene. Open-source is still there, and some even build community and thrive.

What does this all mean?

Tech jargon is everywhere. Lately it's started spreading into the AEC industry. This might be marketing more than real change, but I hope it's the latter. We don't need more silos. Another echo-chamber that construction techies build for themselves, instead of building for the actual builders.

I welcome tech jargon in AEC as long as we learn from it. As long as it helps define our path properly.

But at the end, I still believe it's just information management dressed fancy. The best we can do is remain humble and treat our data mindfully. Stay simple and build upon that simplicity.

What do you think about this shift? Are we honestly evolving or just putting new labels on old problems?

Without quality data strategies, BIM becomes expensive digital drafting, technology solving the wrong problem.

It is not about better modeling software or faster machines, it is about better data architecture, one that boosts our processes, instead of carrying analog bias into digital systems.

We're still thinking in terms of files and folders rather than relationships and dependencies. 

Data architecture as a living system with relationships, dependencies and evolving requirements.

Not just "door type A" but "door type A that connects these two security zones, affects this fire rating calculation, and impacts the HVAC load in adjacent spaces.

Manufacturing kind of solved it, AEC needs to catch up.

What does quality data look like for you?

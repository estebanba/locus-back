Sleek, minimal, plenty of white space, black and white. I see this pattern everywhere in those intentional and well designed sites that end up lost in a sea of similar designs.

What happens to architecture websites? Most of them fall short at communicating effectively. They try to impress other architects, other fans of Mies van der Rohe. They are deployed ivory towers, showing off to other architects while completely missing the people who actually need to hire them. And I am talking just about the good ones.

I've seen two toxic trends. Design that leads to oversimplification, where architecture becomes just a matter of taste. This makes the work seem accessible, less intimidating to clients who might otherwise feel shut out by architectural expertise. 

Or design that leads to commoditization, where they just advertise as another service provider and everyone races to the bottom. If we can't compete on expertise, let's compete on price before someone else does it cheaper.

Both are fear responses. Fear that if architecture seems too complex, clients won't value it. Fear that if it's too expensive, they'll find alternatives. Fear of being replaced by AI, by design-build firms, by clients who think they can just use Pinterest and skip the architect altogether. 

Both strategies are toxic because they're essentially architect-assisted suicide. They're helping to erode the very thing that makes architectural expertise valuable in the first place.

Don't take me wrong. I don't think architecture should use traditional marketing channels in their visual identity, not even its language. Maybe it can work out at the end, financially, but hopefully this is not the price worth paying. Losing its essence just to be what sells. But being empty, thinking this is minimalism, or that only the most design-savvy are worth appreciating it, that's just shortsighted.

Is there a middle path? 

This is a search I've been on for some time. I have been experimenting on my own website. Constrained by the rush of job hunting.

It's a software engineer site, but also an architect site. Professional, but personal, because everything we do is about ourselves at the end. I show my skills in software engineering, data analytics and my projects as an architect. 

Now it's more data oriented. A word cloud extracting skills from all my projects, because granularity is easier than ever today. And a timeline showing every project and milestone chronologically, which is also updated automatically as soon as I add a new section somewhere.

There's some magic implemented under the hood: optimizations, how data is handled, visualization. I'm applying data analytics and modern web technologies.

But at the end, my website looks like any other architect's website.

I would love feedback. What would you like to see in it?

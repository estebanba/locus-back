During the bootcamp data analytics I struggle to find datasets related to AEC to use for my academic projects.

I knew it, the silos! Nobody is sharing their data.

But then something worse, I realised we barely think about data. Just the end product, finish, polished. And we hope to never see it again. Done. Let's start the next one, from scratch.

Data its the raw material of information. Without it, your project is empty, just a random form.

Data is what helps informed decision-making, problem-solving, and understanding the world around us. It provides insights that can improve processes, drive innovation, and make personal and professional lives better.

Data can be found, extracted, obtained, cleaned, arranged, rearranged used, reused, informed, transformed, signified, resignified and the list goes on.

Recognize your data and its potential, be mind to your data, take care of your data, and be mind to others.

The potential is enormous. Imagine if performance data from completed buildings were fed back into early design phases. Or if construction sequencing data could optimize future schedules. The feedback loops we're missing could transform how we build, now.

What I find very insightful is how this connects to manufacturing mindset versus project-based thinking. In manufacturing, you'd never throw away process data because it's what drives continuous improvement. But in AEC, we finish a project and... next!

I've been on my journey for a while now. And as much as the middle path guides me in my personal life, it also does in my professional one.  
  
The middle path is a core teaching that spans from Buddhism to Christianity, in which one thinks and acts consciously, ultimately staying away from extremes.  
  
The main practice isn't about avoiding things or even about moderation. It's about looking for the root causes of desire and thoughts, understanding their causes, their impermanence, and eventually letting them vanish by themselves before engaging in any activity. This is what meditation is about.  
  
We're living in extreme times. They don't do good to anybody. Many suffer in the short term, everybody suffers in the long term.  
  
It's not about keeping the status quo. It's more about thinking when change is really needed. Change for change itself is a waste of energy. Innovation without need is too.  
  
But when you pause... when you ask "why" instead of "how fast"... that's where meaningful work begins.  
  
What would your work look like if you applied the middle path?

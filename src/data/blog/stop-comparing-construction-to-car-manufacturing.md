"Stop Comparing Construction to Car Manufacturing"... but not for the reasons you think.

I have just come across this article defending construction against the usual "be more like automotive" advice.

It is still weird to think that a building could come out of a factory. Normally they don't, but some do, and most fail.

I am also biased, I wished this were the case for a long time, but I believe now that AEC should find it's own way, and for that, some myths should be debunked first.

"The Automotive Recall Crisis"... That Construction Already Has.

Yes, thousands of cars are recalled, moreover if they put passengers or pedestrians in danger. I wish we could recall a building, get a proper one, or at least not having to wait ages for the problem to be solved, god forbid having to demolish or, even worse, evacuate because of collapse, causing a lot of suffering, only to see the same problem appear in the next project.
Both industries make mistakes, one has a systematic response, the other one just call them tragedies instead of recalls.

"Construction Isn’t Like That—And That’s a Good Thing".

No it is not, and it is not worth being different this way.

Buildings are shut down too, if they are not good enough, and more often we could wish. 

Costs of repairs are always high, because recalling is not part of the integral process, it is an exception. Exceptions are expensive. And in construction there are many exceptions.

It is also not true that buildings perform well by default, the truth is that these inefficiencies are always patched with all sort of home-made resources, like the bucket under the leak, or people just conform to live there with a lower quality of life. Housing crisis makes it harder to say no.

Buildings last for decades, not because we want them to, but because we cannot afford to replace them more often, we haven't developed the means, it is either too expensive or too slow, too much paperwork. 

Buildings last for decades not because they are built in a construction site and not in a factory, but in spite of this.

"A Different Kind of Industry".

Buildings are not mass-produced, they are prototypes. Not because they are so complex or innovative, but because we keep stumbling over the same stone. Buildings are almost the same since the times of the roman empire, only with more regulations. We're not creating prototypes by choice, we're recreating the same mistakes. Every project team rediscovering what the last team already learned.

"Yes, construction can and should adopt lessons from other industries—especially around logistics, digital tools, and coordination. But it should not try to become something it’s not." And I can only agree here.

But it is not about the outcome, it is all about the mindset.

Manufacturing treats data as a continuous asset that improves every cycle, while AEC treats it as project-specific waste. This isn't about better software, it's about cultural transformation from craft-based to knowledge-based industry thinking.

"Give Credit Where It’s Due".

But please whatever you do, do not romanticize construction. Living in a nice house is beautiful, but this doesn't mean building it was paradise.

Yes, credit to all the professionals that show up every day and long for a change that does not come. They deserve systems that remember what we've learned instead of starting from scratch every time.

What would construction look like if we stopped throwing away our lessons?

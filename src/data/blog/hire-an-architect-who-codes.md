Hire an architect who codes.  
  
I've been in the job market lately, particularly interested in roles blending software engineering with architecture and construction. What impacts me the most is seeing job openings in more or less traditional AEC companies, or even in Contech, looking for developers, specifying the tech-stack to the detail, but not requiring any industry knowledge.  
  
I have some unsolicited advice for hiring managers: Hire an architect who codes.  
  
It's easier to learn to code than to learn the trade in AEC.  
  
Software is a mature industry with clear paths, abundant resources, structured learning. AEC is still struggling to catch up with basic efficiency. Six years at university plus many years real-world experience, this is not something easy to catch up with. Understanding that concrete doesn't behave like your 3D model. Learning that "simple" means something completely different when you're dealing with soil conditions, weather delays, and human safety.  
  
A software engineer entering AEC? Sure, they'll have to go through all this pain from scratch, getting used to a lot of rework and turtlenecks.  
  
But architects who learned to code? They've been in the trenches. They know why that "simple" feature request isn't simple when it hits real-world construction logic. They've seen projects fail not because of bad code, but because someone didn't understand how buildings actually get built.  
  
If they left for tech and came back... They came back with wisdom.  
  
This applies to many trades, not just architecture. But I'm speaking from first-hand experience here. We bring deep industry knowledge and a new mindset to the table. Something you can't learn from theory or a few client meetings.  
  
Construction has its own language. It's harder to learn than Python or JavaScript.  
  
I will repeat myself: if you're developing products for construction, hire people who know construction. You need someone who can bridge two worlds. Because communication is the most important building element.  
  
But architects can also thrive outside AEC. We're kind of generalists by training. We think about systems, relationships, dependencies. We focus on the what, the why, and the how. Architecture is a vocation that teaches you to see the big picture and the details simultaneously.  
  
Changing construction is titanic work.  
  
The only hope? More architects getting into coding. More builders who understand both worlds. 

Hire an architect who codes. Upskill your architect if you have one already interested in the tech side of design and construction. Show the old guard that a better way is possible.  
  
Yes, this is also self-promotion.  
  
What do you think? Are we undervaluing domain expertise in favor of pure technical skills?
